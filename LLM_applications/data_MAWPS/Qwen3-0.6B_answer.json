Therefore, the remaining flour needed is 16.0 - 42.0 = -26.0 cups. However, since she only used 42.0 cups, which is more than the required 16.0, she doesn't need any flour. So the answer is 0 cups.\nAnswer:\n0\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Calculate the total number of brownies used: 7.0 brownies * 6.0 cups per brownie = 42.0 cups of flour.\n2.

If 15.0 of them did n't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 2.0 groups , how many students would be in each group ?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are in each group after dividing the total number of students who tried out by the number of groups.\n\nFirst, we know that 15.0 students did not get picked for the team. This means that the number of students who did get picked is 25.0 - 15.0 = 10.0 students.\n\nNext, we are told that the rest of the students were divided into 2.0 groups.

If Emily scored 23.0 of the points and everyone else scored 2.0 points each , how many players were on her team ?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nThe total points scored by the team is 39.0. Emily scored 23.0 points, and everyone else scored 2.0 points each. The number of players can be calculated by subtracting Emily's points and the points scored by the other players from the total points. So, the number of players is 39.0 - 23.0 - (2.0 * number of players). But since everyone else scored 2.0 points, the total points from the other players is 2.0 * (number of players - 1). Therefore, the equation becomes 39.0 = 23.0 + 2.0 * (number of players - 1).

The total number of books is 14.0, and the librarian takes 2.0, so the remaining books are 14.0 - 2.0 = 12.0. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how many shelves are required to fit these 12.0 books. Since each shelf can hold 3.0 books, we divide the number of books by the capacity per shelf. This gives us 12.0 / 3.0 = 4.0 shelves.\n\nTherefore, Roger will need 4 shelves.\nAnswer: 4\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Total Books:** 14.0\n2. **Books Taken by Librarian:** 2.0\n3. **Remaining Books:** 14.0 - 2.0 =", "judge": true}, {"question": "It took Amanda 5.0 hours to stroll to Kimberly 's house at 2.0 miles per hour .

So, the number of members who did show up is 11.0 - 6.0 = 5.0. \n\nNext, we multiply the number of members who showed up by the points each scored: 5.0 members \u00d7 9.0 points per member = 45.0 points.\n\nTherefore, the total points scored are 45.0.\nAnswer: 45.0\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Total members: 11.0\n2. Members who didn't show up: 6.0\n3. Members who showed up: 11.0 - 6.0 = 5.0\n4. Each member scored 9.0 points\n5.
